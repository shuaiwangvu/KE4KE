* This is a demo branch *


This repo is for the Knowledge Engineering course for the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.

You are free to reuse the code if you find it helpful.

Here is a quick guidance corresponding to our report.

Step 0 : LOAD
There are two files being loaded. One is a people (FOAF) ontology we created by hand. The other one is a publication knowledge
base we obtained from the PURE system.

    code: index.js line 120 onwards

Step 1 : GENERATE
The main goal of this project is to help visitors find specialists. The first step is to get a list of specialists from
the people ontology: researchers, secretary, project manager, etc.

    code: index.js line 155 onwards. Most work is in the loop from line 158

Step 2: SPECIFY keywords
We interact with the IBM Conversation API to extract keywords from visitors' input. These keywords are predefined from
people knowledge base.

    code: index.js file, around line 474

Step 3: MATCH specialists
We then use the keywords we obtained and match up with our specialists. The results are two lists: the relevant ones and
the irrelevant ones.

    code: index.js file line 483 to 585. Also see the display in file members.hbs

Step 4: RANKING
Due to the limitation of ontology, we are only doing simple ranking by first match first display.

    code: index.js line 542
