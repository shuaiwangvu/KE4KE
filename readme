This is our master branch


This repo is for the Knowledge Engineering course for the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.

You are free to reuse the code if you find it helpful.

Here is a quick guidance corresponding to our report.

Step 0 : LOAD
There are two files being loaded. One is a people (FOAF) ontology we created by hand. The other one is a publication knowledge
base we obtained from the PURE system.

    code: index.js line 120 onwards

Step 1 : GENERATE
The main goal of this project is to help visitors find specialists. The first step is to get a list of specialists from
the people ontology: researchers, secretary, project manager, etc.

    code: index.js line 155 onwards. Most work is in the loop from line 158

Step 2: SPECIFY keywords
We interact with the IBM Conversation API to extract keywords from visitors' input. These keywords are predefined from
people knowledge base.

    code: index.js file, around line 474

Step 3: MATCH specialists
We then use the keywords we obtained and match up with our specialists. The results are two lists: the relevant ones and
the irrelevant ones.

    code: index.js file line 483 to 585. Also see the display in file members.hbs

Step 4: RANKING
Due to the limitation of ontology, we are only doing simple ranking by first match first display.

    code: index.js line 542
